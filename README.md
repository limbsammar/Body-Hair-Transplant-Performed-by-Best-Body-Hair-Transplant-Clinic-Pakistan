Are you in search for [**body hair transplant clinic Pakistan**](https://www.cosmoder.com/bht-body-hair-transplant-pakistan.php)? For the most natural and densely packed hair transplant result, doctors will often harvest hair from the patient's head, chest, and beard. Body hair transplants are execute on patients who have inadequate donor hair, typically in the back of the head.

Normally beard hair grows the longest and lives the longest compared to hair from other regions of the body. Beard hair is the second most preferred hair graft for hair transplant. However, chest hair typically doesn't grow long enough for use. Thus, you donâ€™t need to maintain a consistent hair length to avoid a fake appearance.

**Why do we use body hair transplant?**

Sometimes, a patient's graft count or hair quality isn't high enough to cover his entire bald spot. It gets difficult to provide him with the finest possible hair transplant result. However, that problem, too, has a workable answer. Hair transplants can be performed using either scalp hair or body hair.

For hair transplants, beard or chest hair is typically chosen. Body hair is the next resource to be tapped into as the need to conceal more advanced forms of baldness grows. Beard, chest, underarm, leg, and pubic hairs can all be used to harvest grafts for the procedure.

Body hair transplants can be performed at any time. Doctors do it by taking into account the facts about behavior and the distinct hair cycles of different places of the body.

**Best body hair transplant clinic Pakistan: How many grafts are required?**

Beard, providing around 2,000 to 3,000 grafts, is a suitable donor. And, after the scalp it should be the primary source for hair transplantation. It's simple to pull off beard hairs. They are immune to the effects of the male hormone.

Combining beard hair with scalp grafts in a strategic method can provide extensive coverage. It can be combined with scalp grafts to increase crown density if donor hair is scarce.

Similarly, if the recipient area is vast, chest hair grafts may be the next best alternative. The viability of chest hair graft extraction depends on its thickness, density, and length.

To ensure that only anagen hair follicles are extract through, we recommend shaving the chest 7-10 days before extraction. When the recipient area is vast in comparison to the donor area, grafts from the underarm, leg, or pubic hairs might be working.

**How permanent are hair transplants on the body?**

About 90 to 100 days later, fresh hair growth begins and persists at a typical rate. The transplanted hairs start to seem natural about six months following the procedure and will continue to grow for the rest of your life.

**Conclusion**

Body hair transplants are often execute using the follicular unit extraction (FUE) technique and are complete under local anesthesia.  Thus, body hair transplants can be performed to increase the density of the scalp by covering broad areas. But this happens only if the surgeon has extensive experience with the various types of body hair.
